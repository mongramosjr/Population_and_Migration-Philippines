## Census on Number of Marriages (2017) and Population Census (2002, 2010 & 2015)

The shapefiles utilized in this project can be accessed from the [OCHA Services Repository](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-phl). These shapefiles contain essential geometric data representing the Earth's surface, and they were made available through the efforts of the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) and the Philippines Statistics Authority (PSA). The geometric data allows for precise mapping and analysis of various geographic features. The administrative boundaries' geometry has been simplified using tolerances of 0.01 and 0.001. If you require higher resolution geometry, you can access it through OCHA Services.

Additionally, population and marriage statistics were gathered from [PSA OpenSTAT](https://openstat.psa.gov.ph/Database/Population-and-Migration). Furthermore, population and marriage statistics from PSA OpenSTAT are utilized to gain insights into demographic trends relevant to the project's scope.
